# Lattice Scalar Field Theory Simulation
This repository contains code for the computation of free energy and two-point functions in Euclidean Scalar Field Theory 
on a cubic dd-dimensional lattice with specified self-interaction power. The calculations use the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo 
algorithm (link), and errors are estimated through either jackknife or cross-validation (default 100 folds). Additionally,
it includes comparisons with Feynman diagrammatic techniques for weak (link) and strong (link) coupling regimes. This code
accompanies the article "[Title]" (link) and serves as a supporting material for reproducing the results and analyses 
discussed therein.
